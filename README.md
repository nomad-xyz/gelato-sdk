## Gelato Relay SDK

This crate reimplements [Gelato's Relay SDK](https://github.com/gelatodigital/relay-sdks-monorepo/tree/07b8cec8b8370547e5632b3a6c33362df2f80125/packages/relay-sdk) in Rust. It simply wraps Gelato Relay requests and responses to/from Gelato endpoints with Rust types and methods.
